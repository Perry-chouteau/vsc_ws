Draft code to provide an app letting you handle vscode.workspace file to add, hide or remove deps folder

this app help me in my org P-E-R-R-Y/ to create project with massive deps.

I've made other tool in golang like "P-E-R-R-Y/Pmaker" , that allow you to generate codespace: cmake, cmake/FindDeps, build/, sources/includes. also need to be lift. to improve user experience.

```
1. gh generate github repo
2. git clone
3. vsc_ws update workspace to add/select needed dependencies to show on vscode
4. maker feed the repo
```
example:
